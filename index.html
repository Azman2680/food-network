                <h4>Fire Meat</h4>
                <p>Most Asian butchers will be able to slice the beef for you if you let them know. If not, then the way
                    to do it yourself is to half freeze it so that the piece of beef is almost solid through, then use a
                    sharp kitchen knife to slice pieces, about 2-3mm thick, against the grain.</p>
